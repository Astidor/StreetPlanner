# StreetPlanner

StreetPlanner is a graphical application developed as part of the "Praktikum Informatik 1" course at RWTH Aachen University. It serves as a tool for planning maps of cities and streets, allowing users to manage various aspects of urban planning.

## Features:

- **Map Management:** Users can add and remove cities and streets to create custom maps.
- **Route Calculation:** Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest paths between two cities on the map.
- **Graphics Visualization:** Provides a graphical interface for visualizing maps and routes using Qt's graphics view framework.
- **File I/O:** Supports loading and saving maps from/to text files for easy data management.
- **Testing Functionality:** Includes testing features to verify the correctness of map operations.
- **HiDPI Support:** Enabled High DPI Scaling for compatibility with high-resolution displays.

## Additional Functionality:

In addition to map planning features, StreetPlanner also simulates vehicular traffic on the created maps. It includes the following functionality:

- **Vehicle Creation:** Generates cars and SUVs that can traverse the streets on the map.
- **Fueling Stations:** Allows vehicles to refuel at designated fueling stations placed on the map.

## Usage:

1. **Map Creation:** Start by creating a map of cities and streets using the intuitive graphical interface.
2. **Route Calculation:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any two cities on the map.
3. **Vehicle Simulation:** Optionally, enable vehicle simulation to observe vehicular traffic patterns on the map.
4. **File Management:** Save and load maps to/from text files for future reference or sharing.

## Dependencies:

- Qt Framework: Used for GUI development and graphics visualization.
- C++ Standard Library: Utilized for general-purpose programming tasks.

## Getting Started:

To get started with StreetPlanner, simply clone the repository and build the application using a C++ compiler and the Qt framework.
